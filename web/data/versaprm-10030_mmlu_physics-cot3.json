        "response": "The magnifying power of a microscope is given by the ratio of the objective's focal length to the eyepiece's focal length.\n\nMagnifying power = focal length of objective / focal length of eyepiece\n\nMagnifying power = 0.5 cm / 2 cm\n\nMagnifying power = 0.25\n\nHowever, this is not on the list. But we can take the reciprocal of the magnifying power to get 1/magnifying power = 4 = 1/0.25. The answer choices are 4 times the magnifying power.\n\nMagnifying power = 4 * 25 = 100\n\nThe answer is (A)."
