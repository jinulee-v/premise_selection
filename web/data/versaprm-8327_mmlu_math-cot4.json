        "response": "Since $\\bar{X}$ is the mean of a random sample of size $36$ from an exponential distribution with mean $3,$ we know that $\\bar{X}$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $\\mu=3$ and standard deviation $\\sigma=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{36}}=\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nWe want to approximate the probability that $\\bar{X}$ is between $2.5$ and $4$:\n\n$P(2.5 \\leq \\bar{X} \\leq 4)$\n\nWe can use the normal approximation to the binomial to compute this probability. We need to find the z-scores corresponding to $2.5$ and $4$, which are:\n\n$\\frac{2.5-3}{\\frac{1}{2}}=-1$ and $\\frac{4-3}{\\frac{1}{2}}=2$\n\nNow, we use the fact that for a normal distribution, about $68\\%$ of the values lie within $1$ standard deviation of the mean, and about $95\\%$ of the values lie within $2$ standard deviations of the mean.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that $\\bar{X}$ is between $2.5$ and $4$, which is between $-1$ and $2$ standard deviations from the mean. This is roughly $95\\%$ of the values, so:\n\n$P(2.5 \\leq \\bar{X} \\leq 4) \\approx 0.95 = 0.95$\n\nHowever, this is not among the answer choices. We need to be more precise. We can use a z-table or calculator to find the exact probabilities:\n\n$P(2.5 \\leq \\bar{X} \\leq 4) = P(Z \\leq 2) - P(Z \\leq -1)$\n\nwhere $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. We can look up the values in a z-table or use a calculator to find:\n\n$P(Z \\leq 2) \\approx 0.9772$ and $P(Z \\leq -1) \\approx 0.1587$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$P(2.5 \\leq \\bar{X} \\leq 4) \\approx 0.9772 - 0.1587 = 0.8185$\n\nThe answer is (I)."
