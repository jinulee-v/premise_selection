        "response": "Type I muscle fibers are known to be oxidative, which means they rely on oxygen for energy production, and they are red in color due to the presence of myoglobin which stores oxygen.\n\nThey are also slow contracting and fast fatigueing, however this does not appear to be an option.\n\nThey are also known to be white is incorrect as type I fibers are known to be red, which leaves us with option (B) being incorrect as well.\n\nType I muscle fibers are indeed red, which makes option (H) a viable option, but the contraction speed is slow, which makes option (H) the incorrect option as well.\n\nType I muscle fibers are also glycolytic, which means they use anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, which is incorrect, however this does not make option (D) the correct option as it says \"slow contracting\" which is correct.\n\nThis leaves us with option (D) being the correct answer, white, glycolytic, slow contracting.\n\nThe answer is (D)."
