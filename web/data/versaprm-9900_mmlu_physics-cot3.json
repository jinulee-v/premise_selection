        "question": "Question: The entire power from a 100-hp automobile engine is used to agitate 50 kg of water thermally insulated from its surroundings. How long will it take for the temperature of the water to rise 10 Celsius degrees?\nA. 15 s\nB. 60 s\nC. 28 s\nD. 10 s\nE. 35 s\nF. 40 s\nG. 20 s\nH. 25 s\nI. 45 s\nJ. 50 s",
        "response": "First, we need to convert the horsepower of the engine to watts. There are 746 watts per horsepower, so the engine is 100 x 746 = 74600 watts.\n\nThe heat energy added to the water is the product of the power, the mass of the water, and the temperature change of the water.  Since the specific heat capacity of water is 4186 J/kg/C, the heat energy is 74600 watts times 50 kg times 10 C = 37300000 J.\n\nWe can then use the equation for heat energy, $Q=mc\\Delta T$, and rearrange it to solve for the time, $t=Q/PT$, where $P$ is the power, and $Q$ is the heat energy. This gives us $t=37300000/74600 = 500$ seconds.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match our result. However, we can use the fact that there are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, to convert 500 seconds into 8 minutes and 20 seconds, which is approximately 8 minutes.\n\nHowever, we are also given an approximation of 28 seconds in choice C. Given the choices, this seems to be the best approximation of our result.\n\nThe answer is (C)."
