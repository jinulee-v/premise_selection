        "response": "To calculate the average density of the membrane, we need to calculate the weighted average of the densities of the protein and phosphoglycerides.\n\nDensity of protein = 1.2 g/cm^3, and density of phosphoglyceride = 0.92 g/cm^3.\n\nThe membrane is 60% protein and 40% phosphoglyceride. Therefore, the average density is:\n\n(0.6 * 1.2) + (0.4 * 0.92) = 0.72 + 0.368 = 1.088 g/cm^3.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the average density of the membrane is 1.09 g/cm^3.\n\nThis is greater than the density of the NaCl solution (1.05 g/cm^3), so the membrane material would sediment.\n\nThe answer is (F)."
