        "question": "Question: A deed executed by a grantor conveyed his property for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my brother for life, then to the heirs of my brother. \" A life interest in the property for the life of the brother is worth $20,000 on the date of the conveyance. The total worth of the property is $50,000. The brother accepted but didn't record the deed. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided \"unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. \"Four years later, the grantor purported to convey his property in fee simple absolute to his two sons, by a warranty deed, as a gift. The two sons recorded the deed. Shortly thereafter, the brother ascertained that the grantor's sons were about to take possession of the property. As a consequence, the brother promptly recorded his deed.
