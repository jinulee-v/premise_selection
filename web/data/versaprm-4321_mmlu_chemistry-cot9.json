        "question": "Question: A chemist has a solution which contains Zn^2+ and Cu^2+, each at .02M. If the solution is made 1M in H_3O+ and H_2S is bubbled in until the solution is saturated, will a precipitate form? K_sp of ZnS = 1 \u00d7 10-^22, K_sp of CuS = 8 \u00d7 10-^37, and K_eq for H_2S, when saturated, = 1 \u00d7 10-^22 .\nA. Precipitation of CuS followed by ZnS\nB. Precipitation of ZnS\nC. Precipitation of CuS\nD. Precipitation of an insoluble compound other than ZnS or CuS\nE. Precipitation of ZnS followed by CuS\nF.

        "response": "We need to find the solubility of each compound, and then compare this to the concentration of each compound.\n\nThe solubility of ZnS can be calculated using the equation $K_{sp} = [Zn^{2+}][S^{2-}]$.\n\nSquaring both sides of this equation, we get $K_{sp}^{2} = [Zn^{2+}]^{2}[S^{2-}]^{2}$.\n\nThen solving for $[S^{2-}]$, we have $[S^{2-}] = \\frac{K_{sp}^{2}}{[Zn^{2+}]^{2}}$.\n\nSubstituting in the known values, we get $[S^{2-}] = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-22})^{2}}{(0.02)^{2}}$.\n\nThis is approximately $5 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the solubility of CuS in the same way. $[S^{2-}] = \\frac{(8 \\times 10^{-37})^{2}}{(0.02)^{2}}$.\n\nThis is approximately $2 \\times 10^{-15}$.\n\nSince $[S^{2-}]$ is larger for ZnS than for CuS, ZnS will precipitate first.\n\nThe answer is (B)."
