        "question": "Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\nA. Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\nC. Pelvic ultrasonography\nD. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast",
        "response": "The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a 1-week history of low-grade fever, abdominal cramps exacerbated by bowel movements, and no relief of symptoms after 2 days of antibiotics. She has a history of constipation and has undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago.\n\nGiven the symptoms of abdominal cramps, low-grade fever, and no response to antibiotics, the most likely cause of her symptoms is a complication related to the abdominal surgery.\n\nThe presence of tenderness in the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound, in the absence of bloody stools, urinary symptoms, or abdominal mass, points towards a possible complication such as an adhesive bowel obstruction or a small bowel obstruction.\n\nConsidering her history of abdominal surgery, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform an imaging study to evaluate the bowel and abdominal structures.\n\nOption D, CT scan of the abdomen with contrast, is the best choice as it would provide a comprehensive evaluation of the abdominal structures, including the bowel, and help identify any possible complications such as bowel obstruction, abscess, or other complications related to the surgery.\n\nThe answer is (D)."
