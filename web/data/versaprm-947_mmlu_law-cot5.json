        "question": "Question: A state education agency, following all statutory requirements, obtained a parcel of land through eminent domain. The landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal. For the next 15 years, the agency held the property but did not implement an educational use for it. In year 16, the agency abandoned the intended education use and sold it at a properly advertised auction under state law. The original landowner appealed, arguing that the agency only took a fee simple determinable and when it ceased its intended educational use, superior fee simple title reverted back to the original owner. Will the appellate court likely rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer?\nA. Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\nB. Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition.\nC. No, because the landowner accepted the fair market value and did not object to the transfer within the statutory period.\nD. Yes, because the state agency did not fulfill its statutory obligations by failing to use the land for educational purposes.\nE. Yes, because the landowner can always assert rights to land taken through eminent domain if the purpose is not fulfilled.\nF. Yes, because the agency did not use the land for the purpose stated in the eminent domain proceedings within a reasonable time frame.\nG. No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\nH. No, because the original landowner forfeited all rights to the property once it was sold at the auction.\nI. No, because the state also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession.",
        "response": "The question states that the state agency obtained the land through eminent domain, and the landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal.\n\nThis means that the landowner waived any objections to the taking of the land.\n\nThe agency's subsequent failure to use the land for its intended purpose does not affect the agency's title to the land.\n\nThe landowner's argument that the agency only took a fee simple determinable is not supported by the facts, as the landowner accepted the fair market value and did not object to the transfer within the statutory period.\n\nTherefore, the landowner's rights to the land have been extinguished, and the agency has a valid fee simple title to the property.\n\nThe answer is (G)."
