        "question": "Question: A blood sample is taken from a 45 year old man after he has broken his overnight fast by eating three slices of toast and a boiled egg. Which one of the following will be at a higher concentration than if the blood sample had been taken before breakfast?\n\nA. Cholesterol\nB. Lactate\nC. Glucose\nD. Ketone bodies\nE. Glycogen\nF. Pyruvate\nG. Non-esterified (free) fatty acids",
        "response": "When a person fasts overnight, their body primarily uses stored glucose for energy.\n\nAfter eating breakfast, the body's energy source shifts to the breakdown of glucose from the meal.\n\nThe glucose from the meal causes a spike in blood glucose levels.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of glucose in the blood will be higher after breakfast than before breakfast.\n\nThe answer is (C)."
