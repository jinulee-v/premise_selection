        "response": "For a planet to retain oxygen in its atmosphere, it must have a strong enough gravitational pull to keep the oxygen from escaping into space.\n\nThe escape velocity from the planet is given by the square root of (2 * G * M / r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the radius of the planet.\n\nBut we can also express the mass of the planet as (4/3) * pi * r^3 * rho, where rho is the mean density of the planet.\n\nSubstituting this into the escape velocity equation, we get escape velocity = sqrt(2 * G * (4/3) * pi * r^3 * rho / r) = sqrt(8/3 * pi * G * rho * r^2)\n\nThe planet will retain oxygen if its escape velocity is greater than the escape velocity of oxygen from the planet's surface.\n\nThe escape velocity of oxygen is sqrt(2 * k * T / m), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature of the planet, and m is the mass of an oxygen atom.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get sqrt(8/3 * pi * G * rho * r^2) > sqrt(2 * k * T / m)\n\nSimplifying this, we get 8 * pi * G * rho * r^2 > 6 * k * T / m\n\nSolving for r, we get r > sqrt(3 * m * k * T / (8 * pi * G * rho))\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get r > sqrt(3 * 5.3e-26 kg * 1.38e-23 J/K * 673 K / (8 * 3.14 * 6.67e-11 N*m^2/kg^2 * 5500 kg/m^3))\n\nSimplifying this, we get r > 413.1 km\n\nThe answer is (F)."
