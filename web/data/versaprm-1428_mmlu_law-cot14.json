        "question": "Question: A partnership purchased five acres of unimproved land for purposes of residential development. A state law was subsequently passed requiring the city to prepare a general plan governing both land use and open-space development. The city's plan, with new density requirements, effectively limited development of the five-acre lot to a total of one to five single family residences. The partnership sued the city, asking for a declaratory judgment that the city had taken its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The partnership lost at the local and appellate levels. The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case \u0080\u0094 what did it decide?\nA. This was an unlawful taking without prior notice and therefore unconstitutional.\nB. The law was a violation of the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nC. The partnership had no standing to sue and therefore the case was dismissed.\nD. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\nE. The law was a violation of the takings clause of the U.S. Constitution without just compensation.\nF. The partnership was not deprived of all economic use of their property and therefore it is constitutional.\nG. The law was a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nH. The law was a violation of the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nI. The zoning decision was within the city's rights and therefore constitutional.\nJ. This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.",
        "response": "The partnership's claim is based on the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause, which states that the government cannot take private property without just compensation.\n\nThe question is whether the city's zoning decision constitutes a taking that requires just compensation.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a regulatory taking occurs when a government regulation effectively deprives an owner of all economically viable use of their property.\n\nIn this case, the city's zoning decision limits the partnership's five-acre lot to only one to five single-family residences, effectively depriving them of all economically viable use of their property.\n\nTherefore, the Supreme Court likely decided that the law was a violation of the takings clause of the U.S. Constitution without just compensation.\n\nThe answer is (E)."
