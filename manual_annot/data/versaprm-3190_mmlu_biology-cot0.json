        "response": "Anthropoidea is a suborder of primates that includes the higher primates (monkeys and apes).\n\nThis suborder excludes the prosimians (lemurs, lorises, and bushbabies).\n\nThe superfamily Hominoidea includes the great apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans) and humans.\n\nThe family Hominidae includes the great apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans) and humans, including both modern and extinct members.\n\nThis means that Hominoidea is a larger group that includes Hominidae, but Hominidae is a smaller group within Hominoidea that includes only the great apes and humans.\n\nThe answer is (B)."

The superfamily Hominoidea includes all apes: both the lesser apes (gibbons, family Hylobatidae) and the great apes plus humans (family Hominidae). Therefore, Hominoidea is not limited to great apes and humans as stated."
