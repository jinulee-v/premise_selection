        "first_error_reason": "From rank(M) = 5 (full rank for a 5x5 matrix) it is correct that M is invertible, so step [1] is fine. The first actual error occurs at step [3]: having a unique solution Mx = b for every b is equivalent to M being invertible, which implies det(M) \u2260 0, but the reasoning chain already used invertibility in step [2]. The more fundamental and earlier error, however, is at step [4]: det(M) \u2260 0 implies that the product of eigenvalues is nonzero, hence all eigenvalues are nonzero, so step [4] is correct. The first genuinely incorrect step is [5]: if all eigenvalues are nonzero, then M is invertible, which indeed implies that the homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution, so [5] is also correct. The first wrong step is [7]: linear independence of the columns (i.e., full rank) does not imply that the trace is nonzero. A 5x5 invertible matrix can have trace 0 (e.g., a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 1, 1, 1, -4). Therefore, step [7] is false, and all subsequent steps that rely on it are invalid."
