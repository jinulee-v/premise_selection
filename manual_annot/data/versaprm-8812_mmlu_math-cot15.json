        "first_error_reason": "Step [1] is incorrect. A 5x5 matrix having rank 5 is indeed invertible, but the reasoning chain already fails earlier at step [3]. The first actual logical error is at step [3]: from 'Mx = b has a unique solution for each b' one can conclude that M is invertible (and hence det(M) \u2260 0), but the step as written reverses the implication direction in the overall chain. More fundamentally, the earliest clear mathematical error is at step [4]: 'If det(M) is nonzero, then the eigenvalues of M are all nonzero' is true, but the chain later uses this to argue equivalence with E, F, G, and J while omitting A and I, which are also equivalent. The most blatant false statement is at step [7]: 'If the column vectors of M are linearly independent, then the trace of M is nonzero' is wrong, since there exist invertible (hence with independent columns) 5x5 matrices with trace 0 (e.g., a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1,1,1,1,-4). Therefore, the first clear mathematical error in the reasoning is at index 7."
