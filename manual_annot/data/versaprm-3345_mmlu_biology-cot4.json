        "response": "Advanced animal societies are typically associated with complex behaviors that are observed in species such as primates, dolphins, and elephants.\n\nSome of these complex behaviors include:\n\n- Leadership: Some species, such as wolves and chimpanzees, exhibit leadership behaviors where certain individuals dominate the group.\n\n- Territory and dominance hierarchy: Many species, including birds and mammals, establish territories and dominance hierarchies to regulate access to resources.\n\n- Cultural traditions: Some species, such as chimpanzees and elephants, have been observed exhibiting cultural traditions, such as tool use and hunting strategies.\n\n- Family structure: Advanced animal societies often exhibit complex family structures, such as primate and bird societies that have complex social relationships.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they describe elements found in human societies, not animal societies.\n\nThe answer is (E)."

In fact, several of the listed elements (e.g., cultural traditions in D, family structure and migration patterns in F, habitat selection, mating rituals, and parental care in G) are well-documented in advanced animal societies. Therefore, dismissing all other options as purely human is an overgeneralization and factually wrong."
