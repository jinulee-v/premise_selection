        "question": "Question: The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA. 594 Hz\nB. 588 Hz\nC. 606 Hz\nD. 642 Hz\nE. 636 Hz\nF. 612 Hz\nG. 600 Hz\nH. 618 Hz\nI. 630 Hz\nJ. 624 Hz",
        "response": "The frequency of the echo will be the same as the original frequency of the siren.\n\nThe speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the car is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s.\n\nThe car is effectively closing the distance between the siren and the wall at 3.5 m/s, so the sound waves are effectively being sent towards the wall at 350 m/s + 3.5 m/s = 353.5 m/s.\n\nThe frequency of the sound waves is given by the speed of the waves divided by the wavelength. Since the frequency of the sound waves is not changing, the wavelength is being decreased due to the increased speed of the waves.\n\nSince the wavelength is being decreased, the frequency of the sound waves is being increased.\n\nThe frequency of the sound waves is given by the original frequency times the speed of the waves divided by the original speed of the waves, or (600 Hz)(353.5 m/s)/(350 m/s) = 626.5 Hz.\n\nThe driver hears the echo, which is one round trip of the sound waves, so the frequency will be the original frequency times the speed of the waves divided by the original speed of the waves, times the ratio of the original speed to the speed of the waves during the round trip, or (600 Hz)(353.5 m/s)/(350 m/s) * (353.5 m/s)/(350 m/s) = 626.5 Hz * 353.5/350 = 627.6 Hz * 350/353.5 = 625.7 Hz * 353.5/350 = 625.7 Hz * 350/353.5 = 623.6 Hz * 353.5/350 = 622.6 Hz.\n\nThis is closest to 624 Hz.\n\nThe answer is (J)."

Thus, the driver hears a shifted frequency, not 600 Hz."
