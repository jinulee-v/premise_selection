        "response": "In bacteria, growth refers to an increase in the size of individual cells, while in plants and animals, growth refers to an increase in the number of cells.\n\nIn bacteria, the cell size increases as the cell grows, but in multicellular organisms, growth is the result of cell division.\n\nCell division is a process where a single cell divides into two daughter cells, and this process allows multicellular organisms to grow.\n\nSince bacteria are unicellular, the number of cells remains the same as the cell grows, but in multicellular organisms, the number of cells increases as the organism grows.\n\nThe answer is (D)."

        "first_error_reason": "Step [0] incorrectly states that in bacteriology growth refers to an increase in the size of individual cells. In microbiology, 'growth' typically means an increase in the number of cells (population growth), not just cell enlargement. This also leads to the wrong conclusion in step [4], since option D correctly describes bacterial growth as an increase in the entire population of cells and growth in higher organisms as an increase in size of the individual organism."
