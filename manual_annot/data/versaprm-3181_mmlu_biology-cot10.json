        "first_error_reason": "The conclusion that (C) is correct is based on a misreading of option C. While reverse transcriptase does catalyze the synthesis of DNA from RNA and is used to make cDNA, it is not a 'necessary reagent for genetic engineering with recombinant DNA' in general. Many recombinant DNA procedures do not involve reverse transcriptase at all. The correct exploitation described in the reasoning (making cDNA from RNA) is not accurately captured by any of the listed options, so selecting C is unjustified."
