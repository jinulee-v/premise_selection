The question clearly involves a modified dihybrid ratio (disc, spheroid, elongated) implying two loci and three phenotypes, but step [1] proceeds as if there is only one locus (S/s) and then mislabels the situation as a dihybrid cross without introducing a second gene. All subsequent genotype listings and the 9:3:3:1 claim in steps [2]\u2013[4] are based on this incorrect setup."
