        "response": "The corona is much hotter than the photosphere, but it is much less dense.\n\nAs a result, the corona emits very little visible light.\n\nHowever, the corona does emit X-rays, but these are not visible to the human eye.\n\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the moon blocks the bright light from the photosphere, allowing the faint light from the corona to be visible.\n\nThe answer is (H)."

        "first_error_reason": "The corona does emit visible light; it is faint because it is very diffuse, not because it emits very little visible light. The key issue is its low density and the overwhelming brightness of the photosphere, not a lack of visible emission. Consequently, step [4] is also wrong in choosing (H); the best choice is (F) combined with the fact that the photosphere outshines it."
