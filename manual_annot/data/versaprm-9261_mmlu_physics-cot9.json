        "first_error_reason": "The corona does emit visible light; it is faint because it is very diffuse, not because it emits very little visible light. Its brightness per unit volume is low, but integrated along the line of sight it is visible when the photosphere\u2019s glare is blocked. Therefore, saying it emits very little visible light is misleading. The correct main reason we don\u2019t usually see it is that the bright photosphere overwhelms it (answer C), not that it is too hot to emit visible light (H)."
