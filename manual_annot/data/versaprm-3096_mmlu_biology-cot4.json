        "question": "Question: Explain the mechanism of the genetic determination of sex in man .\nA. The temperature during embryonic development determines the sex.\nB. The presence of an X or Y chromosome in the mother determines the sex of the offspring.\nC. The presence of the X chromosome determines the sex.\nD. The sex is determined by environmental factors after birth.\nE. The presence of two Y chromosomes determines that an individual will be male.\nF. The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male. Fertilization of the X-bearing egg by an X-bearing sperm results in a female offspring, and by a Y-bearing sperm results in a male offspring.\nG. The number of chromosomes determines the sex.\nH. The sex is determined by the mother's genetic contribution exclusively.\nI. The presence of two X chromosomes results in a male offspring.\nJ. The size of the chromosomes determines the sex.",
        "response": "In humans, sex is determined by the presence of the X or Y chromosome in the sperm that fertilizes the egg.\n\nIf the sperm that fertilizes the egg is X-bearing, it will result in a female offspring, because the offspring will receive an X from the mother and another X from the sperm.\n\nIf the sperm that fertilizes the egg is Y-bearing, it will result in a male offspring, because the offspring will receive an X from the mother and a Y from the sperm.\n\nThis means the correct answer must involve the presence of the Y chromosome, but it must not say that the mother contributes the Y chromosome, since the mother only contributes the X chromosome.\n\nThe answer is (F)."
